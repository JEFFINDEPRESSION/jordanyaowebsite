        <h3>The World Wide Web</h3>	
	<p>
     The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators(URLs). They are interlinked by hypertext all over the internet. Hypertext is the text displayed on any electronic display, it includes references to other texts that readers can access immediately by clicking on you mouse 1 button or touching with your finger on any touch-sensitive display. </p>

          <p>Several technologies allow users to access information on the World Wide Web. These include Web browsers, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). To access webpages, you need a web browser. They are programs that display text, data, pictures and any other things such as videos. They provide the software interface that allows you to click onto the hyperlinked resources on the World Wide. These web browsers translate codes to words and images and anything readable for users to read with HTTP and other protocols.</p>
	
	<h3>How the World Wide Web is different from the internet</h3>
	<p>The Internet is a worldwide network of computers, linked mostly by telephone lines; the Web is just one of many things (called applications) that can run on the Internet. When you send an email you are using the Internet, the Internet sends the word that you wrote over the telephone line to your recipient. When you are scanning the Internet for information, you are using the Web over the Internet. The Web is the worldwide collection of text pages, digital photographs, music files, videos, and animations you can access over the Internet. The basis of the Internet is pages of text (webpages). A website is a collection of Web pages. Every website has hyperlinks.</p>
	
	<h3>What is the intranet and how does it relate to the internet?</h3>
	<p>The intranet is a restricted version of the internet. It doesn't allow access to anyone who is not connected to a network. Intranets are like mini internets for business, where they can store relevant information, news and data online, but make it accessible only to those employed by the organisation. The intranet is similar to the internet, but its data is only available within a closed network. This is beneficial to companies who want to collaborate and exchange information privately, but it could also be misused by criminals and other law offenders. Drug dealers may communicate through the intranet because it is private and only they can access it. </p>
	
	<p>Its network comprises of all of its employees and senior level, and in some cases, partners, investors, and shareholders. Intranets typically use a local-only network, which restricts access. Only users wired to the network can access its information. However, with a log in members of the organisation or corporation can access the data from home. An intranet is a platform that allows people to communicate and do many other things such as book holidays and view your pension details. They can be very beneficial for businesses.</p>
	
	<p>In short, the intranet is a restricted form of the internet that only specific people can access through a restricted network. The intranet is especially beneficial for businesses.</p>
	
	<h3>What is an internet protocol?</h3>
	<p>The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol, or set of rules, for routing and addressing packets of data so that they can travel across networks and arrive at the correct destination. Data traversing the Internet is divided into smaller pieces, called packets. IP information is attached to each packet, and this information helps routers to send packets to the right place. Every domain on the Internet has an IP address. The data is divided into packets, and they are assigned an IP address and the packets arrive when the information is needed. Once the packets arrive at their destination, they are handled differently depending on which transport protocol is used in combination with IP. The most common transport protocols are TCP and UDP.</p>
	
	<p>FTP is the client-server protocol which is the communication between computer to computer for transferring the files. The main difference between HTTP and FTP is that FTP is used for downloading and uploading information from the client to the server. HTTP provides a web page from a web server to a web browser. TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, which means a connection is established and maintained until the application programs at each end have finished exchanging messages. It determines how to break up the data into packets that networks can deliver. It consists of 5 main layers.</p>
	
	<p>There would be no web pages without HTTP. Without TCP, there would be no internet, and without FTP, there would be no downloading or uploading.</p>
